## What is Paste?

Paste is a sophisticated clipboard manager that enhances your productivity by storing everything you copy. It allows you to browse through your clipboard history in a visually intuitive timeline and paste previously copied items with a simple shortcut.

The app supports various data types including plain text, rich text, HTML, images, colors, and file paths. With powerful features like favorites, search, and team collaboration, Paste is ideal for professionals who handle multiple pieces of information throughout the day. It integrates seamlessly into your macOS environment and works reliably in the background without slowing down your system.

Paste also offers iCloud synchronization, ensuring that your clipboard history is consistent across your iPhone, iPad, and Mac. The app is built with privacy in mind—your data stays on your devices and is never sent to external servers.
